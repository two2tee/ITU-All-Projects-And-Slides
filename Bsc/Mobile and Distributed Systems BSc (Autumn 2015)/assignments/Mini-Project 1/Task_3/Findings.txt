Test:
Strings / messages were between 50 and 500 characters of length.
Number of messages is 1000 and 10000.
Interval is between: 1, 5 and 10 micro seconds

Localhost:
When we used our own computer as an server and client. All of our sent messages when though. No duplicates or dropped messages.

Ethernet:
Ethernet were a bit better and only dropped about 0-10% of the messages. Still no duplicates.

Wifi:
Wifi were a lot worse. Depending on the number of characters and interval. Anything between 16-60 % of the messages were dropped. Still no duplicates.

Internet:
The internet was the worst. But that has perhaps something to do with the echo server "tiger.itu.dk". In our worst case of our test, only 5 % of the messages were received. The rest were dropped. In our best case about 35 % of the messages were received. Still no duplicates. 

Overall findings:
From our test, we can conclude that the number of dropped messages highly depends on the length / size of the messages and the interval. Where the interval was the most important / effective of them. The number of messages to sent as little to no effect on the number of dropped messages.
