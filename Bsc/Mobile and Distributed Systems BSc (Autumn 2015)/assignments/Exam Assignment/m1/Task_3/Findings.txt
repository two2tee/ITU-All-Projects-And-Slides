Test:
Strings / messages were between 50 and 500 characters of length.
A number of messages are 1000 and 10000.
Interval is between 1, 5 and 10 microseconds

Localhost:
When a single computer was used as a server and as a client. 
All of sent messages went through. No duplicates or dropped messages occurred.

Ethernet:
Ethernet only dropped about 0-10% of the messages. No duplicates occurred.

Wifi:
Wifi was bad depending on the number of characters and intervals. 
Anything between 16-60 % of the messages was dropped. No duplicates occurred.

Internet:
The internet performed worst compared to the other three. 
That may have something to do with the echo server "tiger.itu.dk". 
Worst case of the test, only 5 % of the messages were received. 
The rest were dropped. Best case of the test, about 35 % of the messages were received. No duplicates occurred.

Overall findings:
As a conclusion of the test, the number of dropped messages depends highly 
on the length and size of the messages as well as the interval. 
The interval was the most important factor of the three. 
The number of messages to sent had little to no effect on the number of dropped messages.
