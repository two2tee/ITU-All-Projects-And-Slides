Exercise 3.1
Consider the definition of type ’a BinTree on slide 30. Write a function
inOrder : ’a BinTree -> ’a list
that makes an in-order traversal of the tree and collect the elements in a result list. In-order traversal is defined on
slide 32.
*)

//Definition of a binary tree
type 'a BinTree = 
    |Leaf
    |Node of 'a * 'a BinTree * 'a BinTree;;

//Inorder travesal of tree and collecting items in result list
let rec inOrder tree = 
    match tree with
    |Leaf -> []
    |Node(x,tl,tr) -> (inOrder tl) @ [x] @ (inOrder tr);; 

//Example 
let floatBinTree =
    Node(43.0,Node(25.0, Node(56.0,Leaf, Leaf), Leaf),
    Node(562.0, Leaf, Node(78.0, Leaf,Leaf)));;

inOrder floatBinTree;;


(*
    Exercise 3.2 Write a function
    mapInOrder : (’a -> ’b) -> ’a BinTree -> ’b BinTree
    that makes an in-order traversal of the binary tree and apply the function on all nodes in the tree.
    Can you give an example of why mapInOrder might give a result different from mapPostOrder, but the
    result tree returned in both cases is still the same.

*)

let rec mapInOrder f tree =
    match tree with
    | Leaf -> Leaf
    | Node(x,tl,tr) -> Node(f x, mapInOrder f tl, mapInOrder f tr);;
    
mapInOrder (fun x -> x+2.0) floatBinTree;;  //Applies the function f(x) = x+2 on all nodes in a given tree

//Reason why mapInOrder might give a result different from mapPostOrder but returns same result tree is because of the
// differences in traversal of the tree. However, they will both return the same tree because both function will iterate over all nodes in the tree. 
// The main differences are when the root is visited.


(*
Exercise 3.3 Write a function

    foldInOrder : (’a -> ’b -> ’b) -> ’b -> ’a BinTree -> ’b
that makes an in-order traversal of the tree and folds over the elements.

For instance, given the tree
    let floatBinTree = Node(43.0,Node(25.0, Node(56.0,Leaf, Leaf), Leaf),
    Node(562.0, Leaf, Node(78.0, Leaf,Leaf)))

the application

foldInOrder (fun n a -> a + n) 0.0 floatBinTree

*)


//Fold over elements in inOrder traversal of tree
let foldInOrder f e tree = 
    let list = inOrder tree
    List.fold f e list;;

 //Example (Uses float bin tree from prev task)
foldInOrder (fun n a -> a + n) 0.0 floatBinTree //returns 764.0. which is the correct answer

(* Exercise 3.5 Extend the abstract syntax and the interpreter with if-then and repeat-until statements.
Again we refer to slide 28 in the slide deck from the lecture 5.

    IT = if then
    RU = repeat until

(*
Exercise 3.6 Suppose that an expression of the form inc(x) is added to the abstract syntax. It adds one to the
value of x in the current state, and the value of the expression is this new value of x.
How would you refine the interpreter to cope with this construct?
Again we refer to slide 28 in the slide deck from the lecture 5


    See definition for A in exercise 3.4 where we now include the state
    fst built-in function is used to take the value in the pairs of (expression,state) 
    Now expressions have side effects due to state argument

Exercise 3.7
    Postfix form is a particular representation of arithmetic expressions where each operator is
    preceded by its operand(s), for example:
    (x + 7.0) has postfix form x 7.0 +
    (x + 7.0) ∗ (x − 5.0) has postfix form x 7.0 + x 5.0 − ∗
    Declare an F# function with type Fexpr -> string computing the textual, postfix form of
    expression trees from Section 6.2.
