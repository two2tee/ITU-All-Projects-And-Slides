You worked hard on that parFilter anyway, even though I basically told you the solution in the exercise session :P

So, does map actually handle elements in parallel? No, but that part of the algorithm is not parallelizable. Didn't you take PCPP ;P

parFilterWithTuple: what about using filter and then map on the list instead of foldRight?

parFilterListWrap: it's the same as the first one, LOL
