headOptionFold2 - How does this cover the empty case?: foldRight returns the accumulator straight away for empty Streams
unfold - Why do I need to use the { case ... } construct inside fold instead of just (a,s)?: a and s are the head and the tail of the stream, so you need to pattern match against the function argument in order to access them. They are not provided to your function directly.
